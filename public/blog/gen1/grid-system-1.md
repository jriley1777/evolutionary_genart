# Grid System 1: Foundational Geometric Framework

## ðŸŽ¯ Concept & Vision

Grid System 1 establishes a foundational geometric framework for generative art exploration. This Gen 1 sketch introduces a systematic approach to canvas organization through a modular square grid system, where each square is randomly colored using our curated palette. A second pass adds random circles with 15% probability, and a third pass adds diagonal triangle fills with 15% probability (50-50 chance of top-left to bottom-right or top-right to bottom-left direction). Mouse interaction allows real-time recreation of squares with new random colors, creating layered geometric compositions that balance structure with organic variation and interactive dynamism.

## ðŸŽ¨ Artistic Philosophy

The grid serves as both a visual element and a conceptual foundation. By creating a consistent 50-square height structure that adapts to fill any canvas width, we establish a reliable coordinate system for future generative explorations. The grid's simplicity allows for clear visual hierarchy and systematic pattern development.

The carefully chosen color paletteâ€”ranging from the deep black (rgba(7, 2, 13, 1)) to the bright aero blue (rgba(93, 183, 222, 1))â€”creates a sophisticated, warm-toned aesthetic that balances contrast with harmony. Each square in the grid is randomly assigned one of these five colors, creating a vibrant, mosaic-like composition. A second layer adds circles with 15% probability, and a third layer adds diagonal triangle fills with 15% probability (randomly choosing between top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left directions), ensuring each element uses a different color than its containing square, creating depth and visual interest through geometric layering. Mouse hover interaction allows users to dynamically recreate squares with new random colors, adding an interactive layer of real-time generative art.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Approach

### Grid Calculation
- **Height Division**: Canvas height divided into exactly 50 squares
- **Width Adaptation**: Number of columns calculated dynamically to fill canvas width
- **Responsive Design**: Grid automatically adjusts to window resizing

### Visual Design
- **Colorful Mosaic**: Each square randomly colored from our curated palette
- **Black Outlines**: Thin black strokes define each square for clear structure
- **Random Circles**: 15% probability of circles appearing in squares with contrasting colors
- **Random Triangles**: 15% probability of diagonal triangle fills with contrasting colors (50-50 top-left to bottom-right or top-right to bottom-left)
- **Interactive Recreation**: Mouse hover recreates squares with new random colors and elements
- **Layered Composition**: Three-pass rendering creates depth and visual interest
- **Sophisticated Palette**: Full range of colors from deep black to bright aero blue
- **Dynamic Distribution**: Each interaction creates new color compositions in real-time
- **Interactive Presentation**: Mouse-responsive with real-time generative updates

### Color Palette
The grid system series uses a sophisticated, warm-toned color palette:
- **Black**: `rgba(7, 2, 13, 1)` - Deep blue-black for strong contrast
- **Aero**: `rgba(93, 183, 222, 1)` - Bright sky blue for vibrant accents
- **Alabaster**: `rgba(241, 233, 219, 1)` - Warm off-white for backgrounds
- **Khaki**: `rgba(163, 155, 139, 1)` - Warm grey for secondary elements
- **Dim Gray**: `rgba(113, 106, 92, 1)` - Dark warm grey for primary elements

## ðŸŒ± Evolution Potential
