# Multi Draw: Real-Time Collaborative Drawing with WebSocket Technology

*Creating a shared digital canvas where multiple users can draw together in real-time*

## Overview

Multi Draw is an interactive collaborative art piece that enables multiple users to draw together on a shared digital canvas in real-time. Using WebSocket technology through Socket.IO, the piece creates a seamless multiplayer drawing experience where users can see each other's strokes appear instantly across different browser tabs or devices. This piece demonstrates advanced techniques in real-time communication, collaborative interfaces, and networked creative experiences.

## What Makes It Unique

This piece stands out for its real-time collaborative capabilities:

- **Live multiplayer drawing** with instant synchronization
- **WebSocket communication** for real-time data transmission
- **Cross-device collaboration** allowing multiple users to draw together
- **Simple yet powerful interface** that focuses on the collaborative experience
- **Real-time visual feedback** showing other users' actions immediately

The result is a piece that transforms individual drawing into a shared, social creative experience.

## Core Techniques

### 1. WebSocket Communication Setup

The piece uses Socket.IO for real-time bidirectional communication:

```javascript
import io from 'socket.io-client';

const setup = (p5, canvasParentRef) => {
  const canvas = p5.createCanvas(p5.windowWidth, p5.windowHeight).parent(canvasParentRef);
  canvas.class('canvas-container');
  p5.background(0);
  
  // Connect to the socket.io server
  socket = io('http://localhost:3000', {
    transports: ['websocket'],
    reconnection: true
  });

  // Connection event handlers
  socket.on('connect', () => {
    console.log('Connected to server:', socket.id);
  });

  socket.on('connect_error', (error) => {
    console.error('Connection error:', error);
  });
};
```

The WebSocket connection enables real-time communication between all connected users.

### 2. Real-Time Event Broadcasting

The system broadcasts mouse events to all connected users:

```javascript
const mouseDragged = (p5) => {
  p5.fill(255);
  p5.noStroke();
  p5.ellipse(p5.mouseX, p5.mouseY, 20, 20);

  // send my mouse position to the server
  const data = {
    x: p5.mouseX,
    y: p5.mouseY,
  };
  socket.emit("mouse", data);
}
```

Each mouse movement is captured and sent to the server for distribution to other users.

### 3. Real-Time Event Reception

The piece listens for and displays other users' drawing actions:

```javascript
// listen for other users' mouse events
socket.on("mouse", (data) => {
  p5.fill(255);
  p5.stroke(255);
  p5.ellipse(data.x, data.y, 20, 20);
});
```

Incoming mouse events from other users are immediately rendered on the local canvas.

### 4. Persistent Canvas State

The drawing canvas maintains state across all users:

```javascript
const draw = (p5) => {
  // Keep the background in draw to prevent trails
};
```

The canvas preserves all drawing actions, creating a shared persistent artwork.

### 5. Connection Management

The system handles connection states and errors:

```javascript
socket.on('connect', () => {
  console.log('Connected to server:', socket.id);
});

socket.on('connect_error', (error) => {
  console.error('Connection error:', error);
});
```

Robust connection handling ensures reliable collaborative experiences.

## Generative Art Features

### Real-Time Collaboration

The piece enables:
- **Synchronous drawing**: Multiple users draw simultaneously
- **Instant feedback**: See other users' actions immediately
- **Shared canvas**: All users work on the same digital space
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works across different devices

### Network Communication

The system provides:
- **WebSocket connections**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **Event broadcasting**: Mouse movements shared instantly
- **Connection management**: Robust error handling and reconnection
- **Low latency**: Minimal delay between actions and feedback

### Interactive Drawing

The interface offers:
- **Mouse-based drawing**: Intuitive drag-to-draw controls
- **Visual feedback**: Immediate stroke rendering
- **Shared visual space**: All users see the same canvas
- **Persistent artwork**: Drawing remains across sessions

### Collaborative Experience

The piece creates:
- **Social interaction**: Users can see each other drawing
- **Collective creativity**: Shared artistic expression
- **Real-time coordination**: Users can respond to each other
- **Emergent patterns**: Collaborative drawing creates unique results

## Building Your Own

To create a similar collaborative drawing system:

1. **Set up WebSocket server**: Use Socket.IO for real-time communication
2. **Implement event broadcasting**: Send user actions to all connected clients
3. **Handle real-time reception**: Display incoming events immediately
4. **Manage connections**: Handle connection states and errors
5. **Optimize performance**: Minimize latency and bandwidth usage
