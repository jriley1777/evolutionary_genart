# Particle Flow: Interactive Flow Fields and Dynamic Particle Systems

*Creating responsive, flowing patterns through vector fields and particle physics*

## Overview

Particle Flow is an interactive generative art piece that creates mesmerizing flowing patterns using a dynamic flow field system. Particles follow invisible force vectors that respond to both Perlin noise and mouse movement, creating organic, responsive patterns that feel alive and interactive. This piece demonstrates advanced techniques in particle systems, vector fields, and real-time interaction.

## What Makes It Unique

This piece stands out for its sophisticated approach to creating responsive, flowing art:

- **Dynamic flow fields** that change based on Perlin noise and mouse interaction
- **Particle physics system** with velocity, acceleration, and force application
- **Real-time mouse interaction** that influences particle movement
- **Trail-based rendering** that creates flowing, continuous lines
- **Adaptive particle count** based on canvas size

The result is a piece that responds to user interaction while maintaining organic, natural movement patterns.

## Core Techniques

### 1. Flow Field System

The core of the piece is a dynamic flow field that guides particle movement:

```javascript
// Update flow field
const cols = p5.floor(p5.width / 20);
const rows = p5.floor(p5.height / 20);
flowField = new Array(cols * rows);

for (let y = 0; y < rows; y++) {
  for (let x = 0; x < cols; x++) {
    const index = x + y * cols;
    
    // Calculate angle based on mouse position and noise
    const angle = p5.noise(x * 0.1, y * 0.1, p5.frameCount * 0.01) * p5.TWO_PI * 2;
    
    // Add mouse influence
    const mouseDist = p5.dist(x * 20, y * 20, mouseX, mouseY);
    const mouseInfluence = p5.map(mouseDist, 0, 200, p5.PI, 0, true);
    
    // Combine noise and mouse influence
    const finalAngle = angle + mouseInfluence;
    
    // Create force vector
    const force = p5.createVector(p5.cos(finalAngle), p5.sin(finalAngle));
    force.mult(0.5);
    flowField[index] = force;
  }
}
```

The flow field is a grid of force vectors that particles follow, creating the flowing patterns.

### 2. Particle Physics System

Each particle has a complete physics system:

```javascript
class Particle {
  constructor(p5) {
    this.pos = p5.createVector(p5.random(p5.width), p5.random(p5.height));
    this.vel = p5.createVector(0, 0);
    this.acc = p5.createVector(0, 0);
    this.maxSpeed = p5.random(2, 4);
    this.prevPos = this.pos.copy();
    this.color = p5.color(
      p5.random(180, 280), // Hue - purple to blue range
      p5.random(70, 90),   // Saturation
      p5.random(80, 100)   // Brightness
    );
  }

  update(p5) {
    this.vel.add(this.acc);
    this.vel.limit(this.maxSpeed);
    this.pos.add(this.vel);
    this.acc.mult(0);

    // Wrap around edges and update prevPos to prevent lines
    if (this.pos.x > p5.width) {
      this.pos.x = 0;
      this.prevPos.x = 0;
    }
    if (this.pos.x < 0) {
      this.pos.x = p5.width;
      this.prevPos.x = p5.width;
    }
    if (this.pos.y > p5.height) {
      this.pos.y = 0;
      this.prevPos.y = 0;
    }
    if (this.pos.y < 0) {
      this.pos.y = p5.height;
      this.prevPos.y = p5.height;
    }
  }

  follow(p5, flowField) {
    const x = p5.floor(this.pos.x / 20);
    const y = p5.floor(this.pos.y / 20);
    const index = x + y * p5.floor(p5.width / 20);
    
    if (index >= 0 && index < flowField.length) {
      const force = flowField[index];
      this.applyForce(force);
    }
  }

  applyForce(force) {
    this.acc.add(force);
  }
}
```

Particles use velocity, acceleration, and force application to create natural movement.

### 3. Trail-Based Rendering

The piece uses trail-based rendering to create flowing lines:

```javascript
show(p5) {
  p5.stroke(this.color);
  p5.strokeWeight(1);
  p5.line(this.pos.x, this.pos.y, this.prevPos.x, this.prevPos.y);
  this.updatePrev();
}

updatePrev() {
  this.prevPos.x = this.pos.x;
  this.prevPos.y = this.pos.y;
}
```

By drawing lines between current and previous positions, particles create continuous trails.

### 4. Mouse Interaction System

The flow field responds to mouse movement:

```javascript
// Add mouse influence
const mouseDist = p5.dist(x * 20, y * 20, mouseX, mouseY);
const mouseInfluence = p5.map(mouseDist, 0, 200, p5.PI, 0, true);

// Combine noise and mouse influence
const finalAngle = angle + mouseInfluence;
```

Mouse proximity creates a repelling force that pushes particles away, creating dynamic interaction.

### 5. Perlin Noise Animation

The base flow field uses Perlin noise for organic movement:

```javascript
const angle = p5.noise(x * 0.1, y * 0.1, p5.frameCount * 0.01) * p5.TWO_PI * 2;
```

The noise function creates smooth, non-repetitive patterns that animate over time.
