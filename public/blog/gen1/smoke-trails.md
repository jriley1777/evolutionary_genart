# Smoke Trails: Interactive Smoke Simulation with Organic Particle Physics

*Creating realistic smoke effects through particle systems, turbulence, and interactive emission*

## Overview

Smoke Trails is an interactive generative art piece that simulates realistic smoke using a sophisticated particle system. Users can create smoke by moving their mouse or clicking, and the particles drift upward with natural turbulence, expand in size, and fade over time. This piece demonstrates advanced techniques in particle physics, smoke simulation, and real-time interaction.

## What Makes It Unique

This piece stands out for its realistic approach to smoke simulation:

- **Organic particle physics** with turbulence and natural movement
- **Interactive smoke emission** that responds to mouse input
- **Realistic smoke behavior** including expansion and fading
- **Perlin noise turbulence** that creates natural, non-repetitive movement
- **Dynamic particle lifecycle** with growth, movement, and decay

The result is a piece that feels like creating real smoke trails in the air.

## Core Techniques

### 1. Particle Physics System

Each smoke particle has a complete physics simulation:

```javascript
class Particle {
  constructor(p5, x, y) {
    this.pos = p5.createVector(x, y);
    this.vel = p5.createVector(
      p5.random(-0.5, 0.5),
      p5.random(-2, -1)
    );
    this.acc = p5.createVector(0, 0);
    this.lifespan = 255;
    this.size = p5.random(20, 40);
    this.maxSize = this.size * 2;
    this.growthRate = p5.random(0.1, 0.3);
    this.turbulence = p5.random(0.1, 0.3);
    this.noiseOffset = p5.random(1000);
  }

  update(p5) {
    // Add turbulence using Perlin noise
    const noiseX = p5.noise(this.noiseOffset) * 2 - 1;
    const noiseY = p5.noise(this.noiseOffset + 1000) * 2 - 1;
    this.acc.add(noiseX * this.turbulence, noiseY * this.turbulence);
    
    // Update velocity and position
    this.vel.add(this.acc);
    this.pos.add(this.vel);
    
    // Reset acceleration
    this.acc.mult(0);
    
    // Grow particle
    if (this.size < this.maxSize) {
      this.size += this.growthRate;
    }
    
    // Decrease lifespan
    this.lifespan -= 1;
    
    // Update noise offset
    this.noiseOffset += 0.01;
  }
}
```

Particles use velocity, acceleration, and turbulence to create natural smoke movement.

### 2. Perlin Noise Turbulence

The key to realistic smoke movement is Perlin noise-based turbulence:

```javascript
// Add turbulence using Perlin noise
const noiseX = p5.noise(this.noiseOffset) * 2 - 1;
const noiseY = p5.noise(this.noiseOffset + 1000) * 2 - 1;
this.acc.add(noiseX * this.turbulence, noiseY * this.turbulence);
```

Each particle has its own noise offset, creating independent, organic movement patterns.

### 3. Particle Lifecycle System

Particles have a complete lifecycle with growth and decay:

```javascript
// Grow particle
if (this.size < this.maxSize) {
  this.size += this.growthRate;
}

// Decrease lifespan
this.lifespan -= 1;

isDead() {
  return this.lifespan <= 0;
}
```

Particles start small, grow over time, and fade out as they age.

### 4. Interactive Emission System

The piece responds to mouse input for smoke creation:

```javascript
// Add new particles when mouse is pressed
if (isMousePressed) {
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    particles.push(new Particle(p5, mouseX, mouseY));
  }
}

const mouseMoved = (p5) => {
  mouseX = p5.mouseX;
  mouseY = p5.mouseY;
  isMousePressed = true;
};
```

Multiple particles are created per frame when the mouse is active, creating dense smoke trails.

### 5. Visual Rendering System

The smoke is rendered using circular particles with transparency:

```javascript
show(p5) {
  p5.noStroke();
  const alpha = p5.map(this.lifespan, 0, 255, 0, 0.3);
  p5.fill(200, 200, 200, alpha);
  p5.circle(this.pos.x, this.pos.y, this.size);
}
```

The alpha value is mapped to the particle's lifespan, creating a natural fade effect.

## Generative Art Features

### Realistic Smoke Physics

The smoke simulation includes:
- **Upward drift**: Particles naturally move upward
- **Turbulent movement**: Perlin noise creates organic motion
- **Particle expansion**: Smoke grows as it rises
- **Natural decay**: Particles fade and disappear over time

### Interactive Particle Emission

The system provides:
- **Mouse-driven creation**: Smoke follows mouse movement
- **Click-based emission**: Additional particles on click
- **Continuous trails**: Smooth smoke paths
- **Variable density**: More particles with faster movement

### Visual Effects

The piece creates:
- **Transparency gradients**: Particles fade as they age
- **Size variation**: Random initial sizes with growth
- **Motion blur**: Background fading creates trails
- **Natural color**: Gray smoke with realistic opacity

### Performance Management

The system includes:
- **Particle cleanup**: Dead particles are removed
- **Efficient rendering**: Minimal drawing operations
- **Memory management**: Particle arrays are cleaned up
- **Smooth animation**: Consistent frame rates

## Building Your Own
