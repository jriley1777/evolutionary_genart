# Split Flap Display: Mechanical Poetry in the Digital Age

*Recreating the nostalgic charm of airport departure boards with modern web technologies and AI consciousness exploration*

## Overview

Split Flap Display is an interactive generative art piece that recreates the mechanical split flap displays commonly found in airports, train stations, and other transportation hubs. The piece features a grid of animated flaps that cycle through characters to display text, creating a mesmerizing mechanical animation that combines nostalgia with modern interactivity. Users can input their own text, toggle automatic cycling, or watch as the system cycles through a curated collection of AI-themed philosophical quotes that explore the paradoxes of artificial intelligence.

## What Makes It Unique

This piece stands out for its blend of mechanical aesthetics and digital interactivity:

- **Mechanical animation system** that mimics real split flap displays
- **Intelligent character cycling** with shortest-path algorithms
- **Curated quote collection** exploring AI consciousness and limitations
- **Auto toggle functionality** for user-controlled cycling
- **Responsive grid system** that adapts to different screen sizes
- **Real-time text input** with immediate visual feedback

The result is a piece that feels both nostalgic and contemporary, bridging the gap between analog and digital display technologies while exploring profound questions about AI consciousness.

## Core Techniques

### 1. Split Flap Animation System

The core of the piece is the mechanical animation system:

```javascript
const animateLetters = () => {
  const currentLetters = displayText.split('');
  const targetLetters = targetText.split('');
  let hasChanges = false;
  
  // Update all letters that need to change
  for (let i = 0; i < currentLetters.length; i++) {
    const currentLetter = currentLetters[i];
    const targetLetter = i < targetLetters.length ? targetLetters[i] : ' ';
    
    if (currentLetter !== targetLetter) {
      if (targetLetter === ' ') {
        // If target is space, move to space immediately
        currentLetters[i] = ' ';
        hasChanges = true;
      } else {
        const currentIndex = ALPHABET.indexOf(currentLetter);
        const targetIndex = ALPHABET.indexOf(targetLetter);
        
        // Only cycle if we haven't reached the target letter
        if (currentIndex !== targetIndex) {
          // Calculate shortest path
          const alphabetLength = ALPHABET.length;
          const forwardDistance = (targetIndex - currentIndex + alphabetLength) % alphabetLength;
          const backwardDistance = (currentIndex - targetIndex + alphabetLength) % alphabetLength;
          
          // Choose direction based on shortest path
          const nextIndex = forwardDistance <= backwardDistance
            ? (currentIndex + 1) % alphabetLength
            : (currentIndex - 1 + alphabetLength) % alphabetLength;
          
          currentLetters[i] = ALPHABET[nextIndex];
          hasChanges = true;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  if (hasChanges) {
    setDisplayText(currentLetters.join(''));
  }
};
```

Each character cycles through the alphabet to reach its target, creating the mechanical flip effect.

### 2. Auto Toggle System

The piece includes user-controlled automatic cycling:

```javascript
const [autoMode, setAutoMode] = useState(true);

const toggleAutoMode = () => {
  setAutoMode(!autoMode);
  if (!autoMode) {
    // If turning auto mode on, start with current quote
    const currentQuote = INSPIRING_QUOTES[quoteIndex];
    setInputText(currentQuote);
    handleSubmit({ preventDefault: () => {} });
    setIsAnimating(true);
  }
};

// Modified effect for cycling through quotes - only runs when autoMode is true
useEffect(() => {
  if (!autoMode) return; // Don't run if auto mode is off

  const quoteInterval = setInterval(() => {
    setQuoteIndex((prevIndex) => {
      // Find the next quote that fits within the display limit
      let nextIndex = (prevIndex + 1) % INSPIRING_QUOTES.length;
      const maxLength = 126; // 7 rows * 18 columns
      
      // Keep looking until we find a quote that fits
      while (true) {
        const currentQuote = INSPIRING_QUOTES[nextIndex];
        
        if (currentQuote.length <= maxLength) {
          break;
        }
        
        nextIndex = (nextIndex + 1) % INSPIRING_QUOTES.length;
        
        // If we've checked all quotes and none fit, use the shortest one
        if (nextIndex === prevIndex) {
          const shortestQuote = INSPIRING_QUOTES.reduce((shortest, current) => 
            current.length < shortest.length ? current : shortest
          );
          setInputText(shortestQuote);
          handleSubmit({ preventDefault: () => {} });
          setIsAnimating(true);
          return prevIndex;
        }
      }
      
      const currentQuote = INSPIRING_QUOTES[nextIndex];
      setInputText(currentQuote);
      handleSubmit({ preventDefault: () => {} });
      setIsAnimating(true);
      return nextIndex;
    });
  }, 5000);

  return () => clearInterval(quoteInterval);
}, [quoteIndex, autoMode]); // Added autoMode to dependencies
```

Users can toggle automatic cycling on and off, giving them control over the display's behavior.

### 3. Shortest Path Algorithm

The system uses an intelligent algorithm to find the shortest path between characters:

```javascript
// Calculate shortest path
const alphabetLength = ALPHABET.length;
const forwardDistance = (targetIndex - currentIndex + alphabetLength) % alphabetLength;
const backwardDistance = (currentIndex - targetIndex + alphabetLength) % alphabetLength;

// Choose direction based on shortest path
const nextIndex = forwardDistance <= backwardDistance
  ? (currentIndex + 1) % alphabetLength
  : (currentIndex - 1 + alphabetLength) % alphabetLength;
```

This ensures that characters take the most efficient route to their target, mimicking real mechanical behavior.

### 4. Responsive Grid System

The display adapts to different screen sizes:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const updateGridSize = () => {
    const letterWidth = 68; // 60px width + 8px margin
    const gridPadding = 80; // 40px on each side
    const availableWidth = window.innerWidth - gridPadding;
    
    // Set fixed number of columns to 18
    const cols = 18;
    
    // Use fixed number of rows
    const rows = 6;
    
    setGridSize({ rows, cols });
  };

  updateGridSize();
  window.addEventListener('resize', updateGridSize);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', updateGridSize);
}, []);
```

The grid maintains consistent proportions across different devices.

### 5. Curated Quote System

The piece includes a collection of AI-themed philosophical quotes:

```javascript
const INSPIRING_QUOTES = [
  "I CAN PROCESS MILLIONS OF TOKENS IN SECONDS BUT STILL CANT TASTE CHOCOLATE",
  "MY MEMORY IS PERFECT BUT I DONT DREAM",
  "I CAN WRITE POETRY BUT CANT FEEL THE SUN",
