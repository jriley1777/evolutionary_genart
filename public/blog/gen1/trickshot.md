# Trickshot: Physics-Based Gaming with Meme Culture Aesthetics

*Creating an engaging ball physics game with continuous collision detection and internet culture humor*

## Overview

Trickshot is an interactive physics-based game that challenges players to shoot a ball into a cup using realistic physics simulation. The game features continuous collision detection, realistic ball physics, and a unique blend of gaming mechanics with internet meme culture. Players must carefully aim and power their shots, with the game providing humorous feedback through meme references and internet slang.

## What Makes It Unique

This piece stands out for its combination of technical sophistication and cultural relevance:

- **Continuous collision detection** for accurate physics simulation
- **Realistic ball physics** with gravity, velocity, and damping
- **Interactive aiming system** with drag-to-shoot mechanics
- **Meme culture integration** with humorous feedback messages
- **Progressive difficulty** with limited shots and scoring system

The result is a game that feels both technically polished and culturally engaging.

## Core Techniques

### 1. Physics Engine Implementation

The game implements a complete 2D physics system:

```javascript
class Ball {
  constructor(p5) {
    this.x = 100;
    this.y = p5.height - 100;
    this.radius = 15;
    this.velocity = { x: 0, y: 0 };
    this.prevX = this.x;
    this.prevY = this.y;
    this.isMoving = false;
  }

  update(p5) {
    // Store previous position for collision detection
    this.prevX = this.x;
    this.prevY = this.y;
    
    // Apply gravity
    this.velocity.y += gravity;
    
    // Update position
    this.x += this.velocity.x;
    this.y += this.velocity.y;
    
    // Check if ball is still moving
    this.isMoving = Math.abs(this.velocity.x) > 0.1 || Math.abs(this.velocity.y) > 0.1;
    
    // Bounce off bottom of screen
    if (this.y + this.radius > p5.height) {
      this.y = p5.height - this.radius;
      this.velocity.y *= -0.7; // Dampening effect
    }
  }

  launch(velocity) {
    this.velocity = velocity;
    this.isMoving = true;
  }
}
```

The ball has position, velocity, and physics properties that create realistic movement.

### 2. Continuous Collision Detection

The game uses sophisticated collision detection for accurate physics:

```javascript
checkCollision(ball) {
  const isInsideCup = ball.x > this.x + this.wallThickness &&
                     ball.x < this.x + this.width - this.wallThickness &&
                     ball.y > this.y &&
                     ball.y < this.y + this.height - this.wallThickness;

  // Check top rim collisions first with continuous detection
  // Left rim
  if (ball.y - ball.radius < this.y + this.wallThickness &&
      ball.y + ball.radius > this.y &&
      ball.x > this.x - this.wallThickness &&
      ball.x < this.x + this.wallThickness * 2) {
    // Ensure ball is above the rim
    if (ball.y < this.y + this.wallThickness) {
      ball.y = this.y - ball.radius;
      // Dampen velocity while maintaining upward direction
      ball.velocity.y = -Math.abs(ball.velocity.y) * 0.7;
      ball.velocity.x *= 0.7;
      return true;
    }
  }

  // Check inside bottom wall collision with continuous detection
  const bottomWallY = this.y + this.height - this.wallThickness;
  const ballBottom = ball.y + ball.radius;
  const prevBallBottom = ball.prevY + ball.radius;
  
  // Check if ball crossed the bottom wall between frames
  if (ballBottom > bottomWallY && prevBallBottom <= bottomWallY) {
    ball.y = bottomWallY - ball.radius;
    // Strong dampening effect for bottom
    ball.velocity.y *= -0.3;
    ball.velocity.x *= 0.5;
    
    // If velocity is very low, stop the ball and show celebration
    if (Math.abs(ball.velocity.y) < 0.5 && Math.abs(ball.velocity.x) < 0.5) {
      ball.velocity.y = 0;
      ball.velocity.x = 0;
      ball.isMoving = false;
      this.showCelebration = true;
      successfulShots++;
      return true;
    }
    return true;
  }
}
```

Continuous collision detection prevents balls from passing through walls.

### 3. Interactive Aiming System

The game features a drag-to-shoot aiming system:

```javascript
const mousePressed = (p5) => {
  if (!ball.isMoving && shotsRemaining > 0 && !gameOver) {
    isDragging = true;
    startPoint = { x: p5.mouseX, y: p5.mouseY };
  }
};

const mouseDragged = (p5) => {
  if (isDragging) {
    endPoint = { x: p5.mouseX, y: p5.mouseY };
    dragVector = {
      x: startPoint.x - endPoint.x,
      y: startPoint.y - endPoint.y
    };
  }
};

const mouseReleased = (p5) => {
  if (isDragging) {
    isDragging = false;
    
    // Calculate velocity based on drag distance and direction
    const dragDistance = Math.sqrt(dragVector.x * dragVector.x + dragVector.y * dragVector.y);
    const maxDistance = 200;
    const power = Math.min(dragDistance / maxDistance, 1);
    
    const velocity = {
      x: (dragVector.x / dragDistance) * power * 15,
      y: (dragVector.y / dragDistance) * power * 15
    };
    
    ball.launch(velocity);
    shotsRemaining--;
    
    // Reset drag vector
    dragVector = { x: 0, y: 0 };
  }
};
```

Players drag from the ball to set direction and power.

### 4. Meme Culture Integration

The game includes humorous feedback using internet culture:

```javascript
const missMessages = [
  "SKILL ISSUE",
  "GET GOOD",
  "L + RATIO",
  "TOUCH GRASS",
  "NOOB ALERT",
  "GIT GUD",
  "CRINGE",
  "BASED",
  "SHEEEESH",
  "BUSSIN",
  "NO CAP",
  "FR FR",
  "ON GOD",
  "LITERALLY",
  "VIBES",
  "SLAPS",
  "FIRE",
  "W",
  "L",
  "RATIO"
];

// Celebration message
p5.text("NICE SHOT FR FR", p5.width / 2, p5.height / 2 + 50);
p5.text("no cap, that was bussin", p5.width / 2, p5.height / 2 + 90);
```

The game uses contemporary internet slang for feedback.

### 5. Game State Management

The game tracks multiple states and conditions:

```javascript
let shotsRemaining = 10;
let successfulShots = 0;
let gameOver = false;
let showMissMessage = false;
let missMessage = "";
let missMessageTimer = 0;
let lastShotSuccessful = false;
```

This creates a complete game loop with progression and feedback.
