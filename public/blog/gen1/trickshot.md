# Trickshot: Physics-Based Gaming with Meme Culture Aesthetics

*Creating an engaging ball physics game with continuous collision detection, moving targets, and internet culture humor*

## Overview

Trickshot is an interactive physics-based game that challenges players to shoot a ball into a cup using realistic physics simulation. The game features continuous collision detection, realistic ball physics, moving targets, and a unique blend of gaming mechanics with internet meme culture. Players must carefully aim and power their shots, with the game providing humorous feedback through meme references and internet slang.

## What Makes It Unique

This piece stands out for its combination of technical sophistication and cultural relevance:

- **Continuous collision detection** for accurate physics simulation
- **Realistic ball physics** with gravity, velocity, and damping
- **Interactive aiming system** with drag-to-shoot mechanics
- **Moving targets** that add dynamic challenge
- **Meme culture integration** with humorous feedback messages and GIFs
- **Progressive difficulty** with limited shots and scoring system

The result is a game that feels both technically polished and culturally engaging.

## Core Techniques

### 1. Physics Engine Implementation

The game implements a complete 2D physics system:

```javascript
class Ball {
  constructor(p5) {
    this.x = 100;
    this.y = p5.height - 100;
    this.radius = 15;
    this.velocity = { x: 0, y: 0 };
    this.prevX = this.x;
    this.prevY = this.y;
    this.isMoving = false;
  }

  update(p5) {
    // Store previous position for collision detection
    this.prevX = this.x;
    this.prevY = this.y;
    
    // Apply gravity
    this.velocity.y += gravity;
    
    // Update position
    this.x += this.velocity.x;
    this.y += this.velocity.y;
    
    // Check if ball is still moving
    this.isMoving = Math.abs(this.velocity.x) > 0.1 || Math.abs(this.velocity.y) > 0.1;
    
    // Bounce off bottom of screen
    if (this.y + this.radius > p5.height) {
      this.y = p5.height - this.radius;
      this.velocity.y *= -0.7; // Dampening effect
    }
  }

  launch(velocity) {
    this.velocity = velocity;
    this.isMoving = true;
  }
}
```

The ball has position, velocity, and physics properties that create realistic movement.

### 2. Moving Goal System

The game features dynamic moving targets that add challenge:

```javascript
class Goal {
  constructor(x, y, width, height, wallThickness) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
    this.wallThickness = wallThickness;
    
    // Moving goal properties
    this.isMoving = false;
    this.moveType = 'none'; // 'horizontal', 'vertical', or 'none'
    this.originalX = x;
    this.originalY = y;
    this.moveRange = 60; // How far it moves from center
    this.moveSpeed = 0.02; // Speed of oscillation (slow)
    this.moveTime = 0;
  }

  update(p5) {
    if (this.isMoving) {
      this.moveTime += this.moveSpeed;
      
      if (this.moveType === 'horizontal') {
        this.x = this.originalX + Math.sin(this.moveTime) * this.moveRange;
      } else if (this.moveType === 'vertical') {
        this.y = this.originalY + Math.sin(this.moveTime) * this.moveRange;
      }
    }
  }

  startMoving(moveType) {
    this.isMoving = true;
    this.moveType = moveType;
    this.originalX = this.x;
    this.originalY = this.y;
    this.moveTime = 0;
  }
}
```

Goals can move horizontally or vertically, adding dynamic challenge to the game.

### 3. Enhanced Collision Detection

The game uses sophisticated collision detection for accurate physics:

```javascript
checkCollision(ball) {
  // Check top rim collisions with continuous detection
  // Left rim
  if (ball.y - ball.radius < this.y + this.wallThickness &&
      ball.y + ball.radius > this.y &&
      ball.x > this.x - this.wallThickness &&
      ball.x < this.x + this.wallThickness * 2) {
    if (ball.y < this.y + this.wallThickness) {
      ball.y = this.y - ball.radius;
      ball.velocity.y = -Math.abs(ball.velocity.y) * 0.7;
      ball.velocity.x *= 0.7;
      return true;
    }
  }

  // Check inside bottom wall collision with improved continuous detection
  const bottomWallY = this.y + this.height - this.wallThickness;
  const ballBottom = ball.y + ball.radius;
  const prevBallBottom = ball.prevY + ball.radius;
  
  if (ballBottom >= bottomWallY) {
    ball.y = bottomWallY - ball.radius;
    
    // Much stronger dampening for bottom collisions
    ball.velocity.y *= -0.2; // Very strong dampening
    ball.velocity.x *= 0.3; // Reduce horizontal velocity significantly
    
    // If velocity is very low, stop the ball and show celebration
    if (Math.abs(ball.velocity.y) < 1.0 && Math.abs(ball.velocity.x) < 1.0) {
      ball.velocity.y = 0;
      ball.velocity.x = 0;
      ball.isMoving = false;
      this.showCelebration = true;
      successfulShots++;
      return true;
    }
    return true;
  }
}
```

Continuous collision detection prevents balls from passing through walls and provides realistic physics responses.

### 4. Interactive Aiming System

The game features a drag-to-shoot aiming system:

```javascript
const mousePressed = (p5) => {
  if (!ball.isMoving && shotsRemaining > 0 && !gameOver) {
    isDragging = true;
    startPoint = { x: p5.mouseX, y: p5.mouseY };
  }
};

const mouseDragged = (p5) => {
  if (isDragging) {
    endPoint = { x: p5.mouseX, y: p5.mouseY };
    dragVector = {
      x: startPoint.x - endPoint.x,
      y: startPoint.y - endPoint.y
    };
  }
};

const mouseReleased = (p5) => {
  if (isDragging) {
    isDragging = false;
    
    // Calculate velocity based on drag distance and direction
    const dragDistance = Math.sqrt(dragVector.x * dragVector.x + dragVector.y * dragVector.y);
    const maxDistance = 200;
    const power = Math.min(dragDistance / maxDistance, 1);
    
    const velocity = {
      x: (dragVector.x / dragDistance) * power * 15,
      y: (dragVector.y / dragDistance) * power * 15
    };
    
    ball.launch(velocity);
    shotsRemaining--;
    
    // Reset drag vector
    dragVector = { x: 0, y: 0 };
  }
};
```

Players drag from the ball to set direction and power, with visual feedback showing the drag vector.

### 5. Enhanced Meme Culture Integration

The game includes humorous feedback using contemporary internet culture:

```javascript
const missMessages = [
  "SKILL ISSUE FR",
  "GET GOOD NOOB",
  "L + RATIO + TOUCH GRASS",
  "CRINGE ALERT",
  "BASED ON WHAT?",
  "SHEEEESH NAH",
  "BUSSIN FR FR",
  "NO CAP YOU MISSED",
  "ON GOD YOU SUCK",
  "LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE",
  "VIBES ARE OFF",
  "SLAPS BUT NOT REALLY",
  "FIRE BUT YOU MISSED",
  "W MOMENT (NOT)",
  "L MOMENT FR",
  "RATIO + YOU FELL OFF",
  "GYAT DAMN YOU BAD",
  "FANUM TAX ON YOUR SKILLS",
  "OHIO MOMENT",
  "SIGMA GRINDSET FAIL"
];

// Celebration with GIF integration
if (this.showCelebration) {
  // Draw semi-transparent overlay
  p5.fill(0, 0, 0, 150);
  p5.rect(0, 0, p5.width, p5.height);

  // Draw meme if loaded
  if (this.memeLoaded && this.memeImage) {
    const memeSize = 200;
    p5.image(
      this.memeImage,
      p5.width/2 - memeSize/2,
      p5.height/2 - memeSize/2 - 100,
      memeSize,
      memeSize
    );
  }

  // Draw text
  p5.text("NICE SHOT FR FR", p5.width / 2, p5.height / 2 + 50);
  p5.text("no cap, that was bussin", p5.width / 2, p5.height / 2 + 90);
}
```

The game uses contemporary internet slang and integrates GIFs for celebration feedback.
