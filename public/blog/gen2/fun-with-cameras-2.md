# FunWithCameras2: Barcode Video Slicing

*December 2024*

## Artistic Direction

FunWithCameras2 introduces **video slicing** and **barcode aesthetics** to the camera-based generative art series, creating compositions where live video is divided into vertical strips with varying widths and gaps. This sketch explores how systematic deconstruction of video can create abstract, geometric patterns while maintaining the essence of the original image.

The piece uses mathematical functions to generate slice widths and gaps, creating a rhythmic, barcode-like effect that transforms the continuous flow of video into discrete, geometric elements.

## Core Techniques

### Video Slicing System
- **30 Vertical Slices**: Divides video into 30 vertical strips
- **Variable Widths**: Each slice has a unique width (4-30 pixels)
- **Dynamic Gaps**: Gaps between slices vary from 1-10 pixels
- **Mathematical Generation**: Uses sine and cosine functions for organic variation

### Mathematical Layout Generation
- **Sine Wave Variation**: Slice widths follow sine wave patterns
- **Cosine Modulation**: Gaps modulated by cosine functions
- **Organic Rhythm**: Creates natural, flowing variation in slice sizes
- **Responsive Scaling**: Adapts to different canvas sizes

### Barcode Aesthetic
- **Vertical Stripes**: Creates barcode-like visual pattern
- **Geometric Abstraction**: Transforms continuous video into discrete elements
- **Rhythmic Composition**: Mathematical patterns create visual rhythm
- **Systematic Deconstruction**: Methodical approach to video manipulation

### Photo Mode Integration
- **Grid Capture**: 4x3 grid of captured moments
- **Faster Capture**: 300ms intervals for more dynamic captures
- **Static Display**: Captured frames remain as permanent composition
- **Camera Loading**: Handles camera initialization gracefully

## Evolution from FunWithCameras

**Building Upon**: The camera capture and photo mode from gen1
**New Elements**: 
- Video slicing into vertical strips
- Mathematical generation of slice layouts
- Barcode-like geometric abstraction
- Systematic deconstruction of video

**Maintained**: The camera-based interaction and photo mode functionality

## Technical Implementation

The sketch uses a sophisticated slicing system that:
- Generates 30 slices with mathematically determined widths and gaps
- Uses sine and cosine functions for organic variation
- Scales the layout to fit different canvas sizes
- Maintains the original video aspect ratio within each slice
- Integrates with photo mode for static capture

## Artistic Philosophy

FunWithCameras2 explores how **systematic deconstruction** can reveal new patterns in familiar visual information. The barcode effect creates a bridge between the continuous flow of video and the discrete, geometric patterns of digital art.

The mathematical generation of slice layouts suggests that even the most systematic approaches can create organic, flowing compositions. This creates a balance between the mechanical precision of the slicing system and the natural variation of the mathematical functions.
