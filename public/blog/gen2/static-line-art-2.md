# StaticLineArt2: The Curved Evolution

*Transforming rigid geometry into flowing organic forms through S-curve transformations and curved panel rendering*

## Overview

StaticLineArt2 represents a dramatic evolution from the rigid geometric forms of the first generation, introducing flowing S-curves that transform the systematic columns into organic, wave-like forms. This piece explores the tension between mathematical precision and organic fluidity, creating compositions that feel both structured and naturally flowing.
