# Kaleidoscope 3: Living Psychedelia

*DNA spirals, neural overlays, and organic, living patterns in a psychedelic kaleidoscope*

## Overview
Kaleidoscope 3 takes the fluid visuals of Gen2 and evolves them into a living, biological spectacle. DNA-like spirals, neural networks, and cell division motifs animate across the screen, all wrapped in intense, shifting color cycles. The result is a trippy, organic, and deeply immersive experience.
