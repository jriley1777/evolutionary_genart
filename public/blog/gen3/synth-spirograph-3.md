# SynthSpirograph3: Interactive Physics and Dynamic Behavior

*Transforming mathematical patterns into living, breathing systems with interactive physics and dynamic user influence*

## Overview

SynthSpirograph3 represents a revolutionary evolution of the spirograph concept, introducing interactive physics and dynamic behavior that responds to user input in real-time. Building upon the mathematical foundation and layered complexity of previous generations, this piece transforms static mathematical patterns into living, breathing systems that respond to mouse movement, creating a truly interactive and dynamic experience.

The piece uses physics simulation to create spirographs that respond to user interaction, with mouse movement influencing the speed, direction, and behavior of the patterns. This creates a unique form of generative art where the user becomes an active participant in the creation process, influencing the mathematical beauty in real-time.

## What Makes It Unique

This generation introduces several revolutionary innovations that distinguish it from previous versions:

- **Interactive physics** - Mouse movement directly influences spirograph behavior
- **Dynamic speed control** - Real-time speed changes based on user interaction
