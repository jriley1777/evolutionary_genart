# Kaleidoscope 4: Cosmic Distortion

*Extreme reality distortion, cosmic consciousness, and multidimensional overlays*

## Overview
Kaleidoscope 4 pushes the boundaries of psychedelic art with reality distortion, time dilation, cosmic consciousness, and quantum entanglement. Dimensional overlays and reality fragments create a sense of multidimensional travel, while the visuals become more abstract and cosmic.

## What Makes It Unique
