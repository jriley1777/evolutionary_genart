# Kaleidoscope 5: Infinite Fractal Ego

*Recursive fractals, infinite zoom, liquid glass, and ego dissolution visuals*

## Overview
Kaleidoscope 5 is the ultimate evolution: a recursive, infinitely zooming fractal kaleidoscope with liquid glass effects and visuals that evoke ego dissolution. The patterns melt, morph, and repeat into infinity, with ultra-bright colors and shifting geometry.

## What Makes It Unique
- **Recursive fractal patterns and infinite zoom**
- **Liquid glass and melting visuals**
- **Ego dissolution and breakdown of form**
- **Interactive: click to change segments and recursion depth**
- **Fullscreen support**

## Techniques
- Recursive fractal drawing and infinite zoom
- Particle systems for liquid glass effects
- HSL color cycling for ultra-bright palettes
- Real-time interactivity and fullscreen

## Inspiration
- Mandelbrot fractals, liquid light shows, and the tradition of ego-dissolving visionary art
- Artists: Android Jones, Alex Grey, and the fractal art community
