# Smoke Trails Gen5: Street Art Aerosol

*Exploring the intersection of digital particles and urban art through aerosol techniques, stencils, and street art aesthetics*

## Overview

Smoke Trails Gen5 transforms the particle system into a digital street art studio, where particles become aerosol spray, stencil templates, handstyle tags, wheatpaste layers, chalk marks, and marker lines. This generation explores the techniques and aesthetics of street art, from the precision of stencils to the spontaneity of freehand spray painting.

## What Makes It Unique

This generation stands out for its authentic street art approach:

- **Multiple spray modes** that cycle between freehand, stencil, and tag techniques
- **Street art particle types** including spray, stencil, tag, wheatpaste, chalk, and marker
- **Authentic aerosol behavior** with spray angles, pressure, and spread patterns
- **Urban canvas texture** that mimics real street surfaces
- **Technique-specific behaviors** that reflect real street art methods
- **Performance-optimized** for smooth street art creation

The piece creates an immersive street art experience where users can explore different urban art techniques through particle interactions.

## Core Techniques

### 1. Street Art Particle Types

Six distinct particle types represent different street art techniques:

```javascript
const PARTICLE_TYPES = {
  SPRAY: { name: 'spray', charge: 0, mass: 1, reactivity: 0.2, technique: 'aerosol' },
  STENCIL: { name: 'stencil', charge: 0.1, mass: 1.2, reactivity: 0.1, technique: 'template' },
  TAG: { name: 'tag', charge: 0.3, mass: 0.8, reactivity: 0.4, technique: 'handstyle' },
  WHEATPASTE: { name: 'wheatpaste', charge: -0.2, mass: 1.5, reactivity: 0.05, technique: 'paste' },
  CHALK: { name: 'chalk', charge: 0.2, mass: 0.6, reactivity: 0.3, technique: 'temporary' },
  MARKER: { name: 'marker', charge: 0.4, mass: 0.7, reactivity: 0.6, technique: 'permanent' }
};
```

Each type has unique properties that affect their behavior and appearance.

### 2. Spray Mode System

The piece cycles through three spray modes every 10 seconds:

```javascript
const updateSprayMode = (p5) => {
  const modeTime = Math.floor(p5.frameCount / 600);
  const modes = ['freehand', 'stencil', 'tag'];
  sprayMode = modes[modeTime % modes.length];
  
  switch (sprayMode) {
    case 'freehand':
      sprayPressure = 0.7;
      break;
    case 'stencil':
      sprayPressure = 0.4;
      stencilActive = true;
      break;
    case 'tag':
      sprayPressure = 0.8;
      break;
  }
};
```

Each mode affects particle creation rates and types.

### 3. Aerosol Spray Behavior

Particles simulate realistic aerosol spray patterns:

```javascript
updateSprayBehavior(p5) {
  // Spray angle affects particle movement
  const sprayForce = p5.createVector(
    p5.cos(this.sprayAngle) * this.spraySpread,
    p5.sin(this.sprayAngle) * this.spraySpread
  );
  this.acc.add(sprayForce);
  
  // Spray pressure affects particle creation
  if (p5.random() < 0.02 * sprayPressure && particles.length < MAX_PARTICLES) {
    const newParticle = new Particle(p5, this.pos.x, this.pos.y, this.typeKey);
    newParticle.sprayAngle = this.sprayAngle + p5.random(-0.5, 0.5);
    particles.push(newParticle);
  }
}
```

### 4. Technique-Specific Behaviors

Each particle type has unique behaviors:

```javascript
applyStreetArtTechniques(p5) {
  switch (this.typeKey) {
    case 'STENCIL':
      // Stencil particles create sharp edges
      if (this.stencilMask) {
        this.size *= 0.95; // Sharp edges
      } else {
        this.size *= 1.05; // Fill areas
      }
      break;
    case 'TAG':
      // Tag particles have style-specific behavior
      switch (this.tagStyle) {
        case 'bubble':
          this.size *= 1.02; // Growing bubbles
          break;
        case 'wildstyle':
          this.vel.add(p5.random(-0.5, 0.5), p5.random(-0.5, 0.5));
          break;
        case 'simple':
          this.turbulence *= 0.8; // Clean lines
          break;
      }
      break;
    case 'WHEATPASTE':
      // Wheatpaste particles stick to surfaces
      this.vel.mult(this.pasteAdhesion);
      break;
    case 'CHALK':
      // Chalk particles create dust
      if (p5.random() < 0.1) {
        this.size *= (1 - this.chalkDust);
      }
      break;
    case 'MARKER':
      // Marker particles bleed
      this.size *= (1 + this.markerBleed * 0.01);
      break;
  }
}
```

## Artistic Direction

This generation explores the raw energy and technique of street art. The visual language emphasizes the contrast between precision (stencils) and spontaneity (freehand), between permanence (markers) and impermanence (chalk), between individual expression (tags) and collaborative creation (wheatpaste).
