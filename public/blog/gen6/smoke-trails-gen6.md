# Smoke Trails Gen6: Urban Canvas

*Creating large-scale collaborative art spaces through particle systems that simulate mural creation, multi-artist collaboration, and urban installations*

## Overview

Smoke Trails Gen6 transforms the particle system into a collaborative urban art space, where particles become mural elements, wheatpaste layers, installation pieces, collaborative works, street art, and gallery pieces. This generation explores the creation of large-scale public art through the lens of multiple artists working together on urban canvases.

## What Makes It Unique

This generation stands out for its collaborative urban art approach:

- **Three mural modes** that cycle between collaborative, mural, and installation phases
- **Multi-artist system** with three virtual artists working simultaneously
- **Large-scale composition** with background, foreground, and midground layers
- **Urban art particle types** including mural, wheatpaste, installation, collaborative, street, and gallery
- **Mural progress tracking** that shows the evolution of the artwork
- **Installation phases** that simulate the setup, creation, interaction, and completion of urban art
- **Performance-optimized** for complex collaborative art creation

The piece creates an immersive urban art studio where multiple artists collaborate to create large-scale public art.

## Core Techniques

### 1. Urban Art Particle Types

Six distinct particle types represent different urban art forms:

```javascript
const PARTICLE_TYPES = {
  MURAL: { name: 'mural', charge: 0.2, mass: 1.3, reactivity: 0.3, technique: 'large-scale' },
  WHEATPASTE: { name: 'wheatpaste', charge: -0.1, mass: 1.4, reactivity: 0.1, technique: 'paste' },
  INSTALLATION: { name: 'installation', charge: 0.4, mass: 0.9, reactivity: 0.5, technique: '3D' },
  COLLABORATIVE: { name: 'collaborative', charge: 0.3, mass: 1.1, reactivity: 0.4, technique: 'multi-artist' },
  STREET: { name: 'street', charge: 0.1, mass: 1.0, reactivity: 0.2, technique: 'public' },
  GALLERY: { name: 'gallery', charge: -0.2, mass: 1.5, reactivity: 0.05, technique: 'curated' }
};
```

Each type represents a different approach to urban art creation.

### 2. Multi-Artist Collaboration System

The piece simulates three artists working together:

```javascript
this.artistId = Math.floor(p5.random(artistCount));
this.collaborationStrength = p5.random(0.3, 0.8);

// Artist collaboration affects movement
const collaborationForce = p5.createVector(
  p5.cos(this.artistId * p5.TWO_PI / artistCount) * this.collaborationStrength,
  p5.sin(this.artistId * p5.TWO_PI / artistCount) * this.collaborationStrength
);
this.acc.add(collaborationForce);
```

Each artist has unique characteristics and influences the overall composition.

### 3. Mural Composition Layers

Particles are organized into mural composition layers:

```javascript
this.muralSection = p5.random(['background', 'foreground', 'midground']);

switch (this.muralSection) {
  case 'background':
    this.vel.mult(0.9); // Slower background elements
    break;
  case 'foreground':
    this.vel.mult(1.1); // Faster foreground elements
    break;
  case 'midground':
    this.vel.mult(1.0); // Balanced midground
    break;
}
```

This creates depth and hierarchy in the mural composition.

### 4. Mural Mode System

The piece cycles through three mural modes every 20 seconds:

```javascript
const updateMuralMode = (p5) => {
  const modeTime = Math.floor(p5.frameCount / 1200);
  const modes = ['collaborative', 'mural', 'installation'];
  muralMode = modes[modeTime % modes.length];
  
  // Update installation phase
  installationPhase = Math.floor((p5.frameCount % 2400) / 600);
};
```

Each mode emphasizes different aspects of urban art creation.

### 5. Installation Depth System

Installation particles have 3D depth properties:

```javascript
this.installationDepth = p5.random(-50, 50);

// Installation depth affects 3D positioning
this.installationDepth += p5.random(-0.5, 0.5);
this.installationDepth = p5.constrain(this.installationDepth, -100, 100);

// 3D installation shapes
const depth = p5.map(this.installationDepth, -100, 100, 0.5, 1.5);
p5.ellipse(0, 0, this.size * depth, this.size);
```

This creates a sense of three-dimensional space in the installation.

## Artistic Direction

This generation explores the collaborative nature of urban art creation. The visual language emphasizes the relationship between individual artists and collective creation, between large-scale murals and intimate details, between public street art and curated gallery pieces.
