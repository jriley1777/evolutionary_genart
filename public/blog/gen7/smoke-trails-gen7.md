# Smoke Trails Gen7: Digital Ecosystems

## Concept

SmokeTrails Gen7 explores the concept of digital ecosystems and emergent life behaviors through particle systems. Inspired by cellular automata, Conway's Game of Life, and digital biology, this generation simulates a living digital environment where particles represent different forms of digital life.

## Key Features

### Digital Life Forms
- **Cells**: Basic digital organisms with simple behaviors
- **Viruses**: Parasitic entities that can infect and replicate
- **Bacteria**: Prokaryotic life forms that consume resources
- **Algae**: Photosynthetic organisms that create energy
- **Fungi**: Decomposers that break down digital matter
- **Protozoa**: Predatory organisms that hunt other particles

### Ecosystem Phases
The simulation cycles through four distinct phases:

1. **Birth Phase**: Primordial soup with mostly basic cells
2. **Growth Phase**: Diverse life forms emerge and multiply
3. **Competition Phase**: Predators and parasites dominate
4. **Evolution Phase**: High mutation rates drive adaptation

### Digital Life Properties
Each particle has:
- **DNA**: Unique genetic code that influences behavior
- **Energy**: Life force that must be maintained
- **Age**: Affects energy consumption and reproduction
- **Generation**: Tracks evolutionary lineage
- **Mutations**: Random changes that drive evolution
- **Adaptation**: Ability to survive in changing conditions

### Emergent Behaviors
- **Reproduction**: Particles can divide and create offspring
- **Mutation**: Random genetic changes create diversity
- **Energy Management**: Life forms must consume and conserve energy
- **Population Dynamics**: Ecosystems naturally balance through competition
- **Evolutionary Pressure**: Successful traits are passed down

## Technical Implementation

### Particle System
- **Small Particle Sizes**: 1-14 pixels for precise digital life representation
- **Performance Optimized**: 300 max particles with efficient connection algorithms
