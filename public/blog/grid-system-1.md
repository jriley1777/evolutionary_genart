# Grid System 1: Layered Geometric Foundation

## ðŸŽ¯ Concept & Vision

Grid System 1 establishes a foundational geometric framework for generative art exploration. This Gen 1 sketch introduces a systematic approach to canvas organization through a modular square grid system, where each square is randomly colored using our curated palette. A second pass adds random circles with 15% probability, a third pass adds small circles with 25% probability, and a fourth pass adds diagonal triangle fills with 15% probability (50-50 chance of top-left to bottom-right or top-right to bottom-left direction). Mouse interaction allows real-time recreation of squares with new random colors, creating layered geometric compositions that balance structure with organic variation and interactive dynamism.

## ðŸŽ¨ Artistic Philosophy

The grid serves as both a visual element and a conceptual foundation. By creating a consistent 15-square height structure that adapts to fill any canvas width, we establish a reliable coordinate system for future generative explorations. The grid's simplicity allows for clear visual hierarchy and systematic pattern development.

The carefully chosen color paletteâ€”ranging from the deep black (rgba(7, 2, 13, 1)) to the bright aero blue (rgba(93, 183, 222, 1))â€”creates a sophisticated, warm-toned aesthetic that balances contrast with harmony. Each square in the grid is randomly assigned one of these five colors, creating a vibrant, mosaic-like composition. Multiple layers add circles and diagonal triangle fills with varying probabilities, ensuring each element uses a different color than its containing square, creating depth and visual interest through geometric layering. Mouse hover interaction allows users to dynamically recreate squares with new random colors, adding an interactive layer of real-time generative art.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Approach

### Grid Calculation
- **Height Division**: Canvas height divided into exactly 15 squares
- **Width Adaptation**: Number of columns calculated dynamically to fill canvas width
- **Responsive Design**: Grid automatically adjusts to window resizing

### Object-Oriented Architecture
- **Square Class**: Each grid square is a self-contained object with its own state
- **Seed-Based Generation**: Random seeds determine all visual properties
- **Unique IDs**: Each square has a sequential identifier for tracking and future features
- **Encapsulated Behavior**: Squares manage their own drawing, mouse detection, and regeneration

### Seed System
Each square uses seven random seeds to determine its appearance:
- **squareColor**: Background color selection
- **hasCircle**: Circle presence (15% threshold)
- **circleColor**: Circle color (different from square)
- **hasSmallCircle**: Small circle presence (25% threshold)
- **smallCircleColor**: Small circle color (different from square and regular circle)
- **hasTriangle**: Triangle presence (15% threshold)
- **triangleColor**: Triangle color (different from all other elements)
- **triangleDirection**: Diagonal direction (50-50 split)

### Visual Design
- **Colorful Mosaic**: Each square randomly colored from our curated palette
- **Black Outlines**: Thin black strokes define each square for clear structure
- **Random Circles**: 15% probability of circles appearing in squares with contrasting colors
- **Random Small Circles**: 25% probability of small circles appearing with contrasting colors
- **Random Triangles**: 15% probability of diagonal triangle fills with contrasting colors (50-50 top-left to bottom-right or top-right to bottom-left)
- **Interactive Recreation**: Mouse hover recreates squares with new random colors and elements
- **Layered Composition**: Four-pass rendering creates depth and visual interest
- **Sophisticated Palette**: Full range of colors from deep black to bright aero blue
- **Dynamic Distribution**: Each interaction creates new color compositions in real-time
- **Interactive Presentation**: Mouse-responsive with real-time generative updates

### Color Palette
The grid system series uses a sophisticated, warm-toned color palette:
- **Black**: `rgba(7, 2, 13, 1)` - Deep blue-black for strong contrast
- **Aero**: `rgba(93, 183, 222, 1)` - Bright sky blue for vibrant accents
- **Alabaster**: `rgba(241, 233, 219, 1)` - Warm off-white for backgrounds
- **Khaki**: `rgba(163, 155, 139, 1)` - Warm grey for secondary elements
- **Dim Gray**: `rgba(113, 106, 92, 1)` - Dark warm grey for primary elements

### Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient Mouse Detection**: Direct grid position calculation instead of looping through all squares
- **Color Caching**: Repeated colors are cached to avoid redundant calculations
- **Single Render Loop**: All squares drawn in one pass to prevent double-drawing
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with fallback values for stability
